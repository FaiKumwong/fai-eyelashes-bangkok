        <div className="mb-6">
          <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">1. Cleanse Gently</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Your lash extensions need regular cleaning to stay fresh and healthy. Use a lash-safe cleanser to remove dirt, oils, and makeup residue. Skip the cotton pads and opt for a soft brush or fingertips to avoid pulling on your lashes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            üîë Pro Tip: Clean your lashes at least 2-3 times a week to prevent buildup and irritation.

          <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">2. Avoid Oil-Based Products</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Oil is the enemy of lash adhesive. Make sure your skincare and makeup products are oil-free. From cleansers to moisturizers, double-check the labels to keep your extensions intact.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            üö´ Say no to:<br />
            - Waterproof mascara<br />
            - Oil-based eyeliners<br />
            - Heavy face creams near your eyes

          <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">3. Brush Daily</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Keep your lashes neat and tangle-free by gently brushing them with a clean spoolie brush every morning. This helps maintain their shape and keeps them looking flawless.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">4. Be Gentle</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Lash extensions are delicate, so handle them with care! Avoid rubbing your eyes, tugging at your lashes, or sleeping face-down. Consider a silk or satin pillowcase to minimize friction while you sleep.
          </p>

          <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">5. Schedule Refills</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Lash extensions naturally shed with your natural lashes. To maintain a full, fabulous look, schedule refills every 2 weeks. Regular appointments will keep your lashes lush and lovely.
